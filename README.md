<br>
Write a console program that repeatedly prompts the user to enter data until they type done (any case, Upper, Lower, or Mixed). As they enter the data, assign it to a two-dimension array where the first dimension contains exactly what they type and the second dimension contains the first non-whitespace character of what they type, in lowercase. If they enter a blank line, it is acceptable to skip that line. When they type done, do these steps:display: As Entered or each entry in the array, display the index of the first dimension, the second dimension’s value, and the first dimension’s value on a single line separated by : (colon).display: Bubble Sortedusing a bubble sort, for each entry in the array, display the original index of the first dimension, the second dimension’s value, and the first dimension’s value on a single line separated by : (colon) sorted by the second dimension.display: Selection Sortedusing a selection sort, for each entry in the array, display the original index of the first dimension, the second dimension’s value, and the first dimension’s value on a single line separated by : (colon) sorted by the first dimension.Grading Notes:Please read the instructions carefully! Using the wrong sort or dimension will hurt your grade!The instructor will attempt to crash your program — an exception will cost you 10 points — don’t let exceptions happen!If you ensure that duplicate values are sorted with the lower original array index first, you will get 5 extra points (final score not over 100).You can use the sort methods from the book, but you will get 5 extra points if you do them as inner classes and FULLY comment them.Example:User types:appleAppleZoneappledoneYou display:As entered0:a:apple1:a:Apple2:z:Zone3:a:appleBubble Sorted0:a:apple1:a:Apple3:a:apple2:z:ZoneSelection Sorted1:a:Apple0:a:apple3:a:apple2:z:Zone0
